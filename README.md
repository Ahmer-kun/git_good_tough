Step 1: Set Up Your Artboard

Open Illustrator â†’ File > New â†’ Choose size (e.g. A4 or Poster size).

Set Color Mode to RGB if digital, CMYK if for print.

ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Add the Text

Select the Type Tool (T).

Type:

First line: GOOD

Second line: VIBES

Third line: ONLY

Choose a bold sans-serif font. (e.g., Montserrat ExtraBold, Futura Bold, or Arial Black).

Increase font size so text fills most of the artboard.

Adjust spacing with Character panel (Window > Type > Character).

ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Make the Text Bold & Blocky

Select text â†’ Right-click > Create Outlines (this converts text to shapes).

Ungroup (Object > Ungroup) if needed, so each word is separate.

ðŸ”¹ Step 4: Add the Background Shapes

Use the Rectangle Tool (M) or Pen Tool (P) to create diagonal blocks behind the words.

For example, draw a purple trapezoid behind "GOOD", and an orange trapezoid behind "VIBES".

You can match the angles using the Shear Tool or Rotate Tool.

Send shapes to back (Right-click > Arrange > Send to Back).

ðŸ”¹ Step 5: Apply Colors

From your image:

Yellow for text (#FFD700 or close).

Deep Purple (#2E004F).

Orange (#F7931E).

White background.

You can use the Eyedropper Tool (I) if you sampled colors from the image.

ðŸ”¹ Step 6: Add Depth (Optional)

To give the 3D look like in the example:

Select text â†’ Effect > 3D & Materials > Extrude & Bevel.

Or duplicate text â†’ move slightly â†’ recolor (dark shade) â†’ send backward â†’ creates a shadow effect.

ðŸ”¹ Step 7: Final Adjustments

Align everything using Align panel.

Group elements (Ctrl + G / Cmd + G).

Save as AI file, and export as PNG/JPEG for sharing.
